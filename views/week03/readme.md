# Week 03 - CSS Frameworks

## What I Learned

This week I explored two popular CSS frameworks:

- **Tailwind CSS** - A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development
- **Bootstrap** - A component-based CSS framework for responsive design

## Projects

### Code Examples
Implementation examples for both frameworks are included in the code directory.

### Final Project
**`tailwind.html`** - Final project built with Tailwind CSS
